    "bio": "I finished my Masters in Sustainability Management at Columbia University in 2017 and started my career in Sustainable Finance and Renewable Energy. I was unable to find work that both challeneged me intellectually and satisified me persoanlly, so I decided to learn how to code. Ultimatley I decided that I needed help to learn the necessary skills and decided to attend Fullstack Academy to better learn to code. I am currently looking for a fulltime software engineering position where I can continue to grow and improve as a developer. Feel free to check out some of my sample projects linked below.",
